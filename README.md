# MF-703-Project Proposal

Momentum investing is a well-known trading strategy that suggests investors first compare and rank the historical performances among various stocks, then purchase the past winner stocks and short the past loser stocks to maximize their profits. In 1993, Jegadeesh and Titman(1993) used this strategy and generated significant positive returns over 3- to 12-month holding periods. In our project, we will use Python to replicate this system and backtest it to see whether momentum investing is a robust trading strategy or not. 

•	Simulated stock trading strategy using momentum signal to find the optimal lookback window and holding period that maximized portfolio returns (Python)
•	Analyzed the strategy sensitivity by evaluating the performances in various sectors under different portfolio weights
